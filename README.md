Hi, I am Snehal Ghosh from Kolkata, West Bengal, India. 
I am currently studying at Techno India University, Kolkata in Bachelor of Technology Computer Science and Business System course. 
I aspire to be a Cybersecurity expert.
Being just in 1st year as of March 2024, I have a good command over languages like- C, C++, Java, Python, R.
Apart from this my degree being a unique one, which is a blend of CSE as well as MBA positions me in an unique place.
